Your interview presentation will have three major components 
• “Lunch and Learn” with the MDS students (~40 mins)
• Illumination of a teaching artifact (~15 mins) 
• Presentation of your vision for Educational Leadership in data science and computer science (~20 mins) 

The audience for all of these components will include our current MDS-V students, Computer Science Department faculty, and faculty from the broader MDS-V program and other departments.

“Lunch and Learn” with MDS-V students (30 mins + 10 mins for discussion) 
For this part of the presentation, we ask you to prepare a 30-minute lesson which would be useful and interesting for our Master of Data Science students. We ask you to pick a specific topic of your choice from one of the following general areas:

• Web and cloud computing and working with big data 
• Machine learning for data scientists 
• Deep learning for data scientists 
• Algorithms and data structures for data scientists 

We encourage you to make pedagogical choices that you believe are most appropriate for the topic. Keep in mind that this is for a professional, rather than a research-based, Master’s program. In February, we'll be in Block 5 of the program. You can gain insights into the topics already covered in the program here and access some publicly available materials here. It's acceptable to choose a topic that has been covered in the program. However, we request that you select a slightly more advanced topic that would engage our students at this stage.

Before you begin the lesson, please be sure to clarify:
• the prerequisite knowledge that you expect the students to know before they engage with the topic 
• the learning outcomes you would want your students to be able to attain on the topic When planning, remember to allow some time for questions, just as you would for a real class.

Your presentation should be aimed at students, and be an authentic simulation of your classroom environment. After your 30-minute lesson there will be a 10-minute discussion about the instructional choices you have made. This conversation will focus on classroom pedagogy and delivery. What difficulties would you expect students to have when they engage with this topic? How would you assess students’ learning within the classroom setting?

Equipment available in the room: laptop projector.
 
Teaching artifact (~15 mins, including discussion) 
Present an assignment question, assessment, or any other similar teaching artifact which would help students solidify their understanding of the topic you presented in the first component of the interview. Please also share your solution and the rubric for feedback and grading. Describe examples of both formative and summative assessment you may use. This portion of the interview will demonstrate your creativity and experience in instructional design. 

Data Science Vision (~20 mins, including discussion) 

Appointment to the rank of Assistant Professor of Teaching requires “promise of educational leadership.” Educational Leadership (EL) at UBC is defined as: “an activity taken at UBC and elsewhere to advance innovation in teaching and learning with impact beyond one's classroom.” https://ctlt.ubc.ca/programs/all-our-programs/teaching-and-educational-leadership/ <https://ctlt.ubc.ca/programs/all-our-programs/teaching-and-educational-leadership/> <https://ctlt.ubc.ca/programs/all-our-programs/teaching-and-educational-leadership/> <https://ctlt.ubc.ca/programs/all-our-programs/teaching-and-educational-leadership/&gt;> <https://ctlt.ubc.ca/programs/all-our-programs/teaching-and-educational-leadership/> <https://ctlt.ubc.ca/programs/all-our-programs/teaching-and-educational-leadership/&gt;> <https://ctlt.ubc.ca/programs/all-our-programs/teaching-and-educational-leadership/&gt;> <https://ctlt.ubc.ca/programs/all-our-programs/teaching-and-educational-leadership/&amp;gt;&gt;>

The definition of Educational Leadership is very broad, and we do not intend to prescribe your interests! Please share your vision for teaching and learning innovation. Here are a few sample topics, but you should feel free to choose your own: 
• What are your ideas for programmatic innovation in Data Science degree programs (professional masters, minor and/or major)?
• How will Data Science topics evolve, and how should we adapt our curriculum to include new ideas?
• How can we adapt to ever-increasing interest in Data Science?
• What teaching innovations do you think hold the most promise for Data Science?
• How much emphasis should be put on the tools of Data Science vs. Fundamental instruction in statistics and computer science?

CLOSING WORDS: 
After the interview, we will ask you to submit slides and teaching artifacts for reminder and review.
