    "\n",
    "1. It is a common situation that we want to use a certain batch size but we can't, due to hardware limitations. In order to imitate a large batch size, we can use smaller batches and compute gradients in each iteration, and instead of updating the weights, we can simply accumulate the gradients for a certain number of iterations. Since the gradient is the sum of contributions from each data point, we can wait for as many iterations as we want, and only then update the weights using the accumulated gradient. In this way, we have effectively used a large batch size without causing potential memory problems.\n",
