    "In this course, I want to give you a really solid foundation upon which to build your deep learning skills. There will be a lot of focus on understanding fundamentals and implementing things from scratch. We will progressively build our deep learning skills from understanding optimization algorithms like gradient descent, to building convolutional neural networks for image classification, and even creating generative adversarial networks (GANs) for synthetic image generation! This course will also lay the foundation for the more advanced topics you'll be exploring in DSCI 575 (Advanced Machine Learning), like recurrent neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along the way, I'll include and reference additional material in appendices that dive into some topics in more detail. These are **completely optional** and are there for those who wish to learn more about a particular topic."
